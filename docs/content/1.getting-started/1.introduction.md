Welcome to **Nuxt Shopify**, a Nuxt module integration for Shopify's e-commerce capabilities.

## Overview

Nuxt Shopify is designed to seamlessly integrate Shopify's powerful APIs into your Nuxt application.
To make development easier, the module automatically generates TypeScript types from your GraphQL operations,
hot-reloads on any changes made, auto-imports your GraphQL fragments and provides an easy, pre-configured [mock.shop](https://mock.shop) integration.

No manual type definitions or complex codegen setup required.
