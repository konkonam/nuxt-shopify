The Storefront API is a public API that allows you to access your Shopify store's data, such as products, collections, and customer information.
It is designed to be used in client-side applications, such as a Nuxt.js frontend.
To use the Storefront API, you need to obtain a public or private access token.
See the [Shopify Setup Guide](/essentials/setup-shopify) for detailed instructions on how to obtain these tokens.

## Configuration

Once you have obtained the necessary credentials, you can configure the Storefront client in your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  shopify: {
    name: 'my-awesome-store',
    clients: {
      storefront: {
        apiVersion: '2025-07',
        publicAccessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
      },
    },
  },
})
```
