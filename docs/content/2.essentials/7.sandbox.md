The Nuxt Shopify module creates a sandbox for each API client that
you can access in development mode to explore and test your GraphQL queries.

When starting the Nuxt development server you can then access each sandbox in your browser:

* http://localhost:3000/_sandbox/storefront
* http://localhost:3000/_sandbox/admin

By default, each client sets up a sandbox when running in dev mode.
You can customize this behavior by setting the `sandbox` option in the client config:

```ts [~/nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  shopify: {
    clients: {
      storefront: {
        sandbox: true,
      },
      admin: {
        sandbox: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```
