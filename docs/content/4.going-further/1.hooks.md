The module provides several hooks that can be used to customize its behavior. 
These hooks are available in the `hooks` property of the module configuration and within your Nuxt and Nitro app.

## Using client runtime hooks

You can use the client runtime hooks in a Nuxt plugin or Nitro plugin to customize the behavior of any client:

::code-group
```ts [~/plugins/storefront.ts]
export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
    nuxtApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:configure', ({ config }) => {
        // Modify the config of the client before it is created
        config.logger = logContent => console.log(logContent)
    })

    nuxtApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:create', ({ client }) => {
        // Do something with the client after it is created
        console.log('Storefront client created:', client)
    })

    nuxtApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:request', ({ operation, options }) => {
        // Do something with the operation and options before the request is sent
        console.log('Storefront client request sent:', operation, options)
    })

    nuxtApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:response', ({ response, operation, options }) => {
        // Do something with the response, operations and options after a response is received
        console.log('Storefront client response received:', response, operation, options)
    })

    nuxtApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:errors', ({ errors }) => {
        // Do something with the errors
        console.log('Storefront client errors:', errors)
    })
})
```

```ts [~/server/plugins/storefront.ts]
export default defineNitroPlugin((nitroApp) => {
    nitroApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:configure', ({ config }) => {
        // Modify the config of the client before it is created
        config.logger = logContent => console.log(logContent)
    })

    nitroApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:create', ({ client }) => {
        // Do something with the client after it is created
        console.log('Storefront client created:', client)
    })

    nitroApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:request', ({ operation, options }) => {
        // Do something with the operation and options before the request is sent
        console.log('Storefront client request sent:', operation, options)
    })

    nitroApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:response', ({ response, operation, options }) => {
        // Do something with the response, operations and options after a response is received
        console.log('Storefront client response received:', response, operation, options)
    })

    nitroApp.hooks.hook('storefont:client:errors', ({ errors }) => {
        // Do something with the errors
        console.log('Storefront client errors:', errors)
    })
})
```

```ts [~/server/plugins/admin.ts]
export default defineNitroPlugin((nitroApp) => {
    nitroApp.hooks.hook('admin:client:configure', ({ config }) => {
        // Modify the config of the client before it is created
        config.logger = logContent => console.log(logContent)
    })

    nitroApp.hooks.hook('admin:client:create', ({ client }) => {
        // Do something with the client after it is created
        console.log('Admin client created:', client)
    })

    nitroApp.hooks.hook('admin:client:request', ({ operation, options }) => {
        // Do something with the operation and options before the request is sent
        console.log('Admin client request sent:', operation, options)
    })

    nitroApp.hooks.hook('admin:client:response', ({ response, operation, options }) => {
        // Do something with the response, operations and options after a response is received
        console.log('Admin client response received:', response, operation, options)
    })

    nitroApp.hooks.hook('admin:client:errors', ({ errors }) => {
        // Do something with the errors
        console.log('Admin client errors:', errors)
    })
})
```

## Hooks reference

Hooks allows you to hook into the different stages of the module lifecycle.

### Nuxt Hooks (Build Time)
