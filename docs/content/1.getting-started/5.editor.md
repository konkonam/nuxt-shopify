To get the best developer experience when working with the Nuxt Shopify module, it's recommended to set up your IDE to 
understand the GraphQL schemas provided by Shopify.

## VSCode Setup

To enable the GraphQL language server in VSCode, you can use the VSCode
[GraphQL: Language Feature Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.vscode-graphql)
extension.

For proper syntax highlighting within GraphQL files and inline documents, you can also install the VSCode
[GraphQL: Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql-syntax)
extension.

## GraphQL Config

The Nuxt Shopify module generates the GraphQL schemas for both the Storefront and Admin APIs, depending on which usage, into the `.nuxt/schema` directory.
To enable IDE features like autocompletion and error checking, you can create a `graphql.config.ts` file in the root of your project.

```ts [graphql.config.ts]
import type { IGraphQLConfig } from 'graphql-config'

const config = {
  projects: {
    default: {
      schema: './.nuxt/schema/storefront.schema.json',
    },
    admin: {
      schema: './.nuxt/schema/admin.schema.json',
    },
  },
} satisfies IGraphQLConfig

export default config
```
